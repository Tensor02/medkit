Good morning. I'm John Doe, and I'm 21 years old. I weigh around 53 kilograms  I've been having persistent headaches lately, and I'm a bit worried about it.

Good morning. Can you describe your headaches? Where exactly do you feel the pain, and how long does it last?

The pain is mostly at the back of my head, and it's been happening almost every day for the past two weeks. It's a dull ache that sometimes becomes throbbing.

I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headaches, such as nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, or vision changes?

Yes, sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, especially when the headache is at its worst. I haven't noticed any vision changes, but I do feel more sensitive to light than usual.

Okay, those are important details. Have you been under any unusual stress recently, or have there been significant changes in your lifestyle or diet?

Now that you mention it, I have been working longer hours lately, and my sleep schedule has been irregular. I've also been skipping meals due to work pressure.

Stress, irregular sleep, and poor nutrition can contribute to headaches. However, given the symptoms you've described, I'd like to do a thorough examination to rule out any underlying issues. We may also need to perform some tests like a CT scan or MRI to get a clearer picture.

Okay, I understand. I just want to make sure everything is okay.

Absolutely, it's important to take your health seriously. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for the examination and tests. In the meantime, try to manage stress, maintain a regular sleep pattern, and eat balanced meals.

Thank you. I'll do that and see you at the follow-up appointment.

You're welcome. Take care, and we'll work together to address your concerns.
