Good afternoon, what's your name?

Hi, I'm Michael Johnson.

Hello, Michael. Can you also provide me with your age and weight, please?

I'm 40 years old, and I weigh around 75 kilograms.

Thank you, Michael. Now, let's talk about the symptoms you're here for today. What brings you in?

I've been having sharp pains on the sides of my head, and sometimes it feels like pressure behind my eyes.

Have you experienced any other symptoms like nausea, changes in vision, or ringing in your ears?

No, it's mostly the headaches and occasional pressure behind my eyes.

Alright, we'll need to do a thorough examination and possibly some imaging to better understand what's causing these symptoms.
