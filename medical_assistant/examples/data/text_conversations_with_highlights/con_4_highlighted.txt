Good morning, may I have your name, please?

Good morning, I'm *Emily Brown*.

Nice to meet you, Emily. Can you also tell me your age and approximate weight?

I'm *28* years old, and I weigh around *55* kilograms.

Thank you, Emily. Now, could you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing recently?

I've been having throbbing *headache*s on the front of my head, and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy.

How long have you been experiencing these *headache*s, and have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers?

It's been happening for about a month now, mostly in the afternoons, and I think it gets worse when I'm stressed.
