Good afternoon, what's your name?

Hi, I'm *John Smith*.

Hello, John. Can you also provide me with your age and weight, please?

I'm *45* years old, and I weigh around *80* kilograms.

Thank you, John. Now, let's talk about the symptoms you're here for today. What brings you in?

I've been having persistent *headache*s, especially in the mornings, and sometimes I feel dizzy.

I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms like nausea, changes in vision, or numbness?

No, just the *headache*s and dizziness.

Alright, we'll need to do a thorough examination to understand what might be causing these symptoms.
